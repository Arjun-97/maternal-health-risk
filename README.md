## Objective:
This project aims to support Sustainable Development Goal 3, which addresses Good Health and Well-being, by developing a predictive model for maternal health risks. Using classification in machine learning, this project identifies and assess the risk factors which are related to maternal health, to provide a tool to prioritize care allocate resources efficiently and effectively to reduce maternal mortality rates.

## Motivation:
Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period. It is an important component of healthcare systems all over the world, especially in areas of low-resource where access to timely and adequate care may be limited. By predicting maternal health risks, it can help contribute to informed decision-making for healthcare providers and policymakers, thereby improving outcomes and supporting SDG 3.
